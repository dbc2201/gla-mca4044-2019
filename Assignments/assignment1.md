1. The UI for the app will have three views, namely - an editText, a button and a textView.
2. You may choose to name them as per your wish. 
3. All of the views will be created inside a parent layout. You may choose the parent layout of your choice. (We had used LinearLayout(Vertical) in the class).

**The EditText**  - 

The EditText will be a multi-line editText so that the user can enter multiple lines of text in the app.



**The Button** -

The Button will be a simple button to start the encryption process.



**The TextView**

The TextView will be a simple textview to show the result of the encryption to the user.

#### The naming convention

The naming convention of resources we follow is -

1. For xml (layout) files - `<viewtype>_<elementname>`
   1. for ex - et_name (et is short for editText and name is the name of the element)
   2. btn_log_in
2. For Java (business logic) files - **Pascal Case**
   1. `Button btnLogin;`
   2. `EditText etText;`
